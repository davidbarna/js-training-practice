# JS Training: The Quiz Project

## What is it ?

The quiz is a simple quiz built on client from a [json file](https://github.com/we-learn-js/js-training-practice/blob/master/src/data/quiz.json).

The quiz has a simple schema:

| Property                          | Definition                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title:String`                    | Title of the quiz                                                |
| `questions:Array<Object>`         | Config of questions                                              |
| `questions[]:Object`              |                                                                  |
| `questions[].problem:String`      | Question's title                                                 |
| `questions[].input:Object`        | Field to display                                                 |
| `questions[].input.type:String`   | 'radio', 'checkbox', 'inputs' or 'input' (default)               |
| `questions[].input.options:Array` | labels of the options (only for 'radio', 'checkbox' or 'inputs') |

## Refactor phases

### 1. Operators And Closures

[![branch-icon] refactor/operators-closures](https://github.com/we-learn-js/js-training-practice/tree/refactor/operators-closures)

* Change scopes of variables from global scope to local scope.
* Declare variables with `let`, `const` or `var`.
* Use destructuring when possible.
* Use operator expressions for conditionals and value assignment.

### 2. Strings

[![branch-icon] refactor/strings](https://github.com/we-learn-js/js-training-practice/tree/refactor/strings)

* Convert strings to template strings.

### 3. Functions

[![branch-icon] refactor/functions](https://github.com/we-learn-js/js-training-practice/tree/refactor/functions)

* Split all logic in functions as pure as possible.
* Use new arrow functions syntax when possible.
* Respect functional principles:
  * Immutability
  * Absence of side effects
  * Function don't depend on state
  * Functions with 1 input/ 1 output.
